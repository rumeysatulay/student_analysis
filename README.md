# Student Analysis

## Overview

This project explores factors affecting student exam scores using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The aim is to identify relationships between exam performance and various factors like study habits, parental involvement, extracurricular activities, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset, obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors/code), includes the following columns:

- `Hours_Studied`
- `Attendance`
- `Parental_Involvement`
- `Access_to_Resources`
- `Extracurricular_Activities`
- `Sleep_Hours`
- `Previous_Scores`
- `Motivation_Level`
- `Internet_Access`
- `Tutoring_Sessions`
- `Family_Income`
- `Teacher_Quality`
- `School_Type`
- `Peer_Influence`
- `Physical_Activity`
- `Learning_Disabilities`
- `Parental_Education_Level`
- `Distance_from_Home`
- `Gender`
- `Exam_Score`

## Project Goals

The key objectives of this analysis include:

1. Investigating how various factors like study habits and attendance influence exam scores.
2. Identifying the strongest predictors of student performance.
3. Visualizing trends and patterns in student performance based on these factors.

## Process

1. **Data Cleaning (Python)**
- Data Type Corrections: Ensured all columns have the correct data types.
- Handling Missing Data: Checked for any null values in the dataset.
- Outlier Detection: Examined the categorical data columns for outliers and inconsistencies.
2. **Data Analysis & Visualization (Power BI)**
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Performed in-depth analysis to find correlations between exam scores and other variables.
- Visualizations: Created charts and graphs to represent relationships between various factors and student performance.
