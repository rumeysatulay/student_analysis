# Student Analysis

## Overview

This project explores factors affecting student exam scores using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The aim is to identify relationships between exam performance and various factors like study habits, parental involvement, extracurricular activities, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset, obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors/code), includes the following columns:

- `Hours_Studied`
- `Attendance`
- `Parental_Involvement`
- `Access_to_Resources`
- `Extracurricular_Activities`
- `Sleep_Hours`
- `Previous_Scores`
- `Motivation_Level`
- `Internet_Access`
- `Tutoring_Sessions`
- `Family_Income`
- `Teacher_Quality`
- `School_Type`
- `Peer_Influence`
- `Physical_Activity`
- `Learning_Disabilities`
- `Parental_Education_Level`
- `Distance_from_Home`
- `Gender`
- `Exam_Score`

## Project Goals

The key objectives of this analysis include:

1. Investigating how various factors like study habits and attendance influence exam scores.
2. Identifying the strongest predictors of student performance.
3. Visualizing trends and patterns in student performance based on these factors.

## Process

1. **Data Cleaning (Python)**
- Data Type Corrections: Ensured all columns have the correct data types.
- Handling Missing Data: Checked for any null values in the dataset.
- Outlier Detection: Examined the categorical data columns for outliers and inconsistencies.
2. **Data Analysis & Visualization (Power BI)**
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Performed in-depth analysis to find correlations between exam scores and other variables.
- Visualizations: Created charts and graphs to represent relationships between various factors and student performance.

## Outcomes

- The analysis is based on data from 6,607 students, who come from diverse schools and backgrounds. This variety provides a comprehensive view of factors influencing student performance across different contexts.

- Looking at the gender distribution, we find that 57.33% of the students are male, with the remaining being female. When comparing exam results by gender, the average exam score for male students is 67.23, while for female students, it is 67.24. Additionally, the average scores for previous exams are nearly identical for both genders. There is no significant difference in the minimum and maximum results between genders. Therefore, we can conclude that there is no notable difference in performance between male and female students.

- Next, I examined the effect of parental involvement on exam results. The average exam scores for different levels of parental involvement are as follows: high level – 68.09, medium level – 67.10, and low level – 66.36. These results indicate that parental involvement does not have a significant impact on exam scores.
